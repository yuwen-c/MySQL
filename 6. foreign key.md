## foreign key constraint

- parent table
- child table
  - child table references parent table.
  
- the two keys may have different names!

## ways to put a FK constraint

- at the same time when you create a table
```
create table sales(
purchase_number int,
date_of_purchase date,
customer_id int,
item_code varchar(255),
primary key(purchase_number),
foreign key(customer_id) references customers(customer_id)
);
```

- after that, use alter
```
alter table sales
add foreign key (customer_id) references customers(customer_id);
```

- manipulate workbench GUI
??
??
??

## on delete cascade

- use ON DELETE CASCADE with foreign key
```
foreign key(customer_id) references customers(customer_id) on delete cascade;
```
if a customer_id has been deleted from "parent table", the related data in child table will be deleted too.

## DDL
- run this command to see the DDL of table:
```
show create table sales;
```
we will see:
```
CONSTRAINT `sales_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`customer_id`) REFERENCES `customers` (`customer_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1
```

## delete a FK constraint

- run this command:
```
alter table sales
drop FOREIGN KEY sales_ibfk_1;
```
