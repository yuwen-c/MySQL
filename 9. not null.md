[difference between alter CHANGE, alter MODIFY](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14767174/modify-column-vs-change-column)

> CHANGE COLUMN If you have already created your MySQL database, and decide after the fact that one of your columns is named incorrectly, you don't need to remove it and make a replacement, you can simply rename it using change column.
> ```
> ALTER TABLE MyTable CHANGE COLUMN foo bar VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL FIRST;
> ```
> MODIFY COLUMN This command does everything CHANGE COLUMN can, but without renaming the column.You can use the modify SQL command if you need to resize a column in MySQL. By doing this you can allow more or less characters than before. You can't rename a column using modify and other
> ```
> ALTER TABLE MyTable MODIFY COLUMN foo VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL AFTER baz;
> ```
> Note : ALTER TABLE is used for altering a table means to change column name, size, drop column. CHANGE COLUMN and MODIFY COLUMN commands cannot be used without help of ALTER TABLE command.

- alter change: rename a column
```
alter table XXX
change column col1, col1(repeat or use a nename) type
```
- alter modify: all the things that change can do BUT rename
```
alter table XXX
modify column col1 type      (w/o repeat)
```
